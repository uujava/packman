Learning java project implemented with my son on a couple of weekends
Here we learned:
 - object oriented programming
 - refactoring
 - byte operation
 - java swing
 - java2d graphics
 - MVC
 - simple threading
 - javax sound API
It does not provide any tests, build tools or whatever used in production development. 
Just the java language API intorduced.
Use Intellij Idea Community Edition to edit and run the project. 
Entry point is GamePackman.
