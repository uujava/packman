Learning java project implemented with my son on a couple of weekends.
Started from cimple circle drawing we learned:
 - object oriented programming
 - refactoring
 - byte operation
 - java swing
 - java2d graphics
 - MVC
 - simple threading
 - javax sound API
It does not provide any tests, build tools or whatever used in production development. 
Just the java language API introduced.

Usage
- Use Intellij Idea Community Edition to open the project.
- Run com.company.GamePackman
- Fixed size window 1920x1080 used - full hd monitor is needed. A bit of code changes needed to run it on smaller screen size.
- Keys used to drive packman:
 w - up
 a - left
 d - right
 s - down
